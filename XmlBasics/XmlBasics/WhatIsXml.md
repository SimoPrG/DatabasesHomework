# What does the XML language represent? What is it used for?

Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format which is both human-readable and machine-readable.

Although the design of XML focuses on documents, it is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used in web services.
